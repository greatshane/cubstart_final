# How It Works
Our calorie counter gives college students a way of tracking their daily nutrition. All they need to do is input everything they ate in a day and they will receive detailed nutrition information powered by the API Ninjas Nutrition API. They will also be able to read up on the importance of maintaining a healthy diet (even in college).

Our site also offers an special way of adding what you ate to the site - through images! Our second page features a way to count your calories and sugar through uploading images. This feature is powered by the Owlbot API and the Tensorflow Neural Net.
